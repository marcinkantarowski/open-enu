# Deployment

One command takes a bare VPS to every subdomain live. This is what it does, what it refuses
to do, and what to reach for when something is wrong.

## Two stages, one server or two

| | staging | production |
|---|---|---|
| What runs | the **dev** stack - hot reload, Mailpit, profiler | immutable images |
| Checkout | `/opt/<slug>-staging` | `/opt/<slug>-prod` |
| Compose project, containers, DB volume | `<slug>-staging-*` | `<slug>-prod-*` |
| Who can reach it | `STAGING_ALLOW_FROM` only (IP allowlist) | everyone |
| Git deploy key | **read-write** (`github-staging`) - commits made there are pushed | read-only |
| Backups | none - staging data is disposable | nightly, off-box, required |

Both can live on one server or on one each. On one server they share exactly one thing: the
**edge** (`enu-edge`, `docker/edge/`), a single Traefik that owns ports 80/443 and Let's
Encrypt for every stack on the box. Nothing else is shared - not a directory, a network, a
database or a systemd unit.

## The first time

```bash
make preflight   HOST=deploy@203.0.113.42 DOMAIN=example.com REPO=acme/open-enu

make deploy-key  HOST=deploy@203.0.113.42 REPO=acme/open-enu                 # production, read-only
make deploy-key  HOST=deploy@203.0.113.42 REPO=acme/open-enu STAGE=staging   # staging, read-write

make buildstaging HOST=deploy@203.0.113.42 DOMAIN=stg.example.com REPO=acme/open-enu EMAIL=ops@example.com
make buildprod    HOST=deploy@203.0.113.42 DOMAIN=example.com     REPO=acme/open-enu EMAIL=ops@example.com
```

Point `HOST` at the same server for both, or at two. `buildstaging` allows the address you
run it from (`ALLOW=ip,cidr` to choose); change it later in the staging `.env` and run
`make edge` on the server - no restart. **One server running both needs 4 GB of RAM**: the dev
stack alone runs three Nuxt dev servers.

`preflight` is read-only and takes about ten seconds; every `build*` runs it again as step 0.
Both stages use Let's Encrypt's **production** CA - a staging-CA certificate is untrusted by
browsers, and staging is used in one. While debugging DNS, set `LE_CA_SERVER` to the staging
directory: five failed authorisations an hour lock a hostname out for a week.

## The loop: vibe code, look, promote

**Code anywhere; production only ever gets what staging ran.**

```bash
# on the staging server - the stack hot-reloads as files change
ssh deploy@…  &&  cd /opt/<slug>-staging  &&  claude
git commit -am "…"

# or on your machine, with the local dev stack (make builddev)
git push                       # then pull it into staging:
make deploystaging HOST=deploy@… DOMAIN=stg.example.com

# when staging looks right
make promote                                    # on the staging server, prod on the same box
make promote PROD=deploy@prod-ip                # on the staging server, prod elsewhere
make promote STAGING=deploy@stg [PROD=deploy@…] # from your machine
```

`promote` refuses a dirty staging checkout (a release is commits, not a working tree), refuses
when origin has commits staging has not run, pushes staging's own commits, runs
`make promote-gate` (arch, tests, typecheck) **on staging**, then moves production to that
exact SHA and releases it: build → back up → migrate → restart → health. It tags
`prod-<timestamp>`, so "what was live when" is a `git tag` away. Code only - staging's
database never goes near production.

`deploystaging` fast-forwards staging and never overwrites uncommitted or unpushed work there.
Running `promote` from the staging server with production on **another** server means that
server holds an SSH key to production - a real widening of what a compromised staging box
reaches. Promoting from your machine avoids it.

## Subsequent releases without staging

```bash
make deployprod HOST=deploy@203.0.113.42 DOMAIN=example.com REF=v1.4.0
```

Runs `make ci` locally first and refuses if it is red, then releases that ref with the same
`scripts/remote/release.sh` promote uses. `SKIP_CI=1` exists and is a footgun.

**Not zero-downtime.** `docker compose up -d` recreates changed containers and a
single-replica service is unavailable for the seconds that takes. Two replicas behind
Traefik with health-gated rotation is the documented path to changing that, and is
deliberately not in v1.

## What each command refuses to do

| It will not | Because |
|---|---|
| Change a DNS record | A `buildprod` that quietly rewrites a live zone is not a tool anyone should trust near production. `dns-check` writes the fixes; `make dns-apply` applies them, with a token you supplied |
| Register a deploy key as a side effect of a build | Same principle. `make deploy-key` is a separate, deliberate act |
| Harden sshd before proving you can still log in | The order is: create the user → install the key → **open a second connection and verify** → only then touch `sshd_config`. If the verification fails, the file is never edited |
| Overwrite a secret | `.env` is created once and read forever after. Regenerating `APP_SECRET` invalidates every session; regenerating `APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` makes every encrypted column unreadable, permanently |
| Expose staging to everyone | It is the dev stack: the profiler shows environment variables and Vite serves source files. `edge.sh` refuses to register it with an empty `STAGING_ALLOW_FROM`, and `prod-check` fails if a staging router lacks the allowlist or the stack publishes a port |
| Overwrite work on staging | `deploystaging`, `promote` and a re-run `buildstaging` all refuse to touch uncommitted or unpushed changes in the staging checkout |
| Call `buildprod` finished without an off-box backup | The stack comes up, then the command exits non-zero naming the variable to set. A `pg_dump` on the same disk as the database is a hope, not a backup |
| Migrate without dumping first | Backup, then migrate, in that order, every time |

## Preflight, check by check

Ten checks (.ai/platform/PLAN.md §10.2). The one that matters is **10: can the *server* read the repo.**
Checks 8 and 9 pass on your laptop because your laptop holds your GitHub credentials - the
server does not, and that is exactly where the first `git clone` fails.

When DNS is wrong, `dns-check` writes `.out/dns/${DOMAIN}/`:

- **`zone.txt`** - the complete desired record set as a BIND file. Import it with "overwrite
  existing" and the zone converges in one action. Cloudflare: DNS → Records → Import and
  Export → Import.
- **`cloudflare.sh`** - only the deltas, created or patched by id, safe to re-run. Needs
  `CF_API_TOKEN` with `Zone:DNS:Edit` on that one zone.
- **`records.json`** - the same desired state for Terraform, Route 53 or your own tooling.

**Leave Cloudflare's proxy off.** It breaks Mercure SSE and hides the origin from HTTP-01
validation. Preflight warns when `api.` (which serves Mercure) resolves into a Cloudflare range.

## No git remote yet?

```bash
SYNC=rsync make buildstaging HOST=deploy@… DOMAIN=stg.example.com
```

Pushes your working tree instead of cloning - including anything uncommitted, which is why
it is not the default. `deploy*` refuses to run against a server provisioned this way,
because there is no ref to move to.

## Backups

Nightly at 03:17 (plus up to fifteen minutes of jitter, so the whole internet does not hit
the same bucket at 03:00): `pg_dump -Fc` → `age --encrypt` → `rclone copy` to
`BACKUP_REMOTE`. The `.env` and the JWT keys go up as a second encrypted bundle, because a
database alone does not bring a dead server back - without those, every session breaks and
every encrypted column is lost.

**The private half of the age key is deliberately not on the server.** A backup that an
attacker holding the server can decrypt protects against disk failure and nothing else.

```bash
make backup-verify HOST=deploy@…    # pulls the latest REMOTE dump, restores it into a
                                    # scratch container, checks the schema and row counts
make restore HOST=deploy@…          # destructive; asks for the database name, and takes a
                                    # safety dump of the current state first
```

`backup-verify` reads the remote object, not a local copy - the remote one is what exists
after the disk dies.

## When it goes wrong

| Symptom | Look at |
|---|---|
| Provision stops at DNS | `.out/dns/${DOMAIN}/` - the fixes are already written |
| `$HOST cannot read $REPO` | `make deploy-key HOST=… REPO=…` (add `STAGE=staging` for the staging checkout) |
| Staging answers 403 | Your address is not in `STAGING_ALLOW_FROM` - edit the staging `.env`, then `make edge` on the server |
| `promote` says staging is behind origin | `make deploystaging` first: production only gets what staging has run |
| `promote` cannot push | Staging's deploy key is read-only - `make deploy-key … STAGE=staging` and tick write access |
| Certificates never issue | Port 80 reachable? CAA record naming another CA? Cloudflare proxy on? All three are preflight checks |
| Stack up, health gate red | `ssh $HOST 'cd /opt/<slug>-prod && docker compose logs --tail=80 api; docker logs --tail=80 enu-edge'` |
| Deploy failed mid-migration | Nothing was restarted; the old containers are still serving. The pre-deploy dump is in `/opt/<slug>-prod/backups`; the rollback command is printed |
| Need the database locally | `make tunnel HOST=… [STAGE=staging]` → `postgres://…@127.0.0.1:15432/…` for one session |
| Gone after a reboot | `systemctl status <slug>-prod.service` / `<slug>-staging.service` - the reason a kernel update at 4am is not an outage |

## What is checked, and what is not

`make arch` runs `prod-check`, which asserts the production stack's invariants against the
**rendered** compose config: no application source bind-mounted (it would make
`opcache.validate_timestamps=0` serve stale code), no published database or cache port, every
third-party image pinned, every public router resolving a certificate, no development
services - and the **staging** stack's: no published port, every router behind the allowlist,
and no script that names `compose.dev.yml` itself (which would drop the staging override on
the server). `make selftest` proves each of those fails when broken.

`shell-check` runs ShellCheck over every script at `-S warning`, because the shell here is
what runs against real servers with root.

The edge in both modes was run live on spare ports: two local stacks side by side, and a server-mode
edge rendering its ACME config, answering 403 outside the allowlist and 200 with noindex and
HSTS inside it.

**Not covered by any automated test in this repository:** the scripts have never been run
end to end against a real VPS - `provision`, `release`, `deploy` and `promote` included. Their logic is linted and their refusals are tested; the
provisioning path itself is verified the first time you point it at a server.
