/**
 * Browser tests against the REAL dev stack.
 *
 * Not a mocked API and not a preview build: the five behaviours these cover -
 * cookie login, tenant switch, impersonation, server-sent events, and the 409
 * conflict bar - are precisely the ones that pass in unit tests and then fail in
 * a browser, because they depend on cookie attributes, on two realms sharing a
 * signing key, and on a connection staying open.
 *
 * Run by `make e2e`, which is in `make ci` and deliberately NOT in `make check`:
 * it needs the whole stack up, and a 60-second pre-commit gate cannot ask for
 * that (.ai/platform/PLAN.md §13).
