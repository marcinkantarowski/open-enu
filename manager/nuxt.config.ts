   * The marker the smoke test looks for.
   *
   * `app.head` is baked into the HTML shell at build time, so it is present even
   * on the two apps that do not render on the server - which is the point: a
   * smoke test that only checks for HTTP 200 passes on an error page, and one
   * that checks for a page's own words breaks the moment somebody edits the
   * copy. This also proves each HOST reaches the app it is supposed to: three
   * routes pointing at one container would otherwise look perfectly healthy.
   *
   * The value is a role, never the project name - `make init` rewrites the
   * project name, and a check that compares against something the tool rewrites
   * inverts itself (see .ai/platform/lessons/sentinel-strings-must-not-be-renameable.md).
