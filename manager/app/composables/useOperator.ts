/**
 * Operator sessions, which differ from tenant sessions in three ways.
 *
 *  1. A different endpoint and a different token audience (`manager`), so an
 *     operator token is refused on `/api` and a tenant token here (ADR-0007).
 *  2. **No refresh, by design.** The backend issues no cookie: a lapsed session
 *     means logging in again, which is a reasonable thing to ask of someone
 *     whose account reaches every tenant's data. The practical consequence is
 *     that a page reload signs the operator out - deliberate, not a bug.
 *  3. No tenant and no memberships. An operator is not a member of anything;
 *     authority comes from the realm, not from a role inside a workspace.
