#!/usr/bin/env bash
# =============================================================================
#  Give a stage on the server access to one repository (.ai/platform/PLAN.md §10.3).
# =============================================================================
#  A repo-scoped deploy key, generated ON the server and never leaving it -
#  not a copy of your personal SSH key. If the box is compromised the blast
#  radius is read access to one repository, not your GitHub account.
#
#  Idempotent at every step: an existing key is reused, an already-registered
#  key is reported and skipped.
#
#  Two stages, two keys, one ~/.ssh/config:
#
#    production  read-only, used as github.com          (the server only pulls)
#    staging     WRITE, used as the alias github-staging (commits vibe coded on
#                staging are pushed from there, and `make promote` tags)
#
#  A write key is a real widening of the blast radius, so it exists only for the
#  stage that needs it - and GitHub scopes it to this one repository.
#
#  Usage: deploy-key.sh HOST REPO [staging|production]
# =============================================================================
