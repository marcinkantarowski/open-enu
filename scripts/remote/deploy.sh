# =============================================================================
#  Move one stage to a git ref, from your machine (.ai/platform/PLAN.md §9.1).
# =============================================================================
#  `provision.sh` sets a stage up. This moves one that is already running.
#
#    staging      pull REF into the staging checkout, fast-forward only, then
#                 release. This is how work from your laptop reaches staging.
#                 It REFUSES when the staging checkout has uncommitted changes
#                 or commits of its own that are not on REF - that is somebody's
#                 vibe-coded work, and a deploy is not allowed to erase it.
#    production   run `make ci` here, move the production checkout to REF, and
#                 release. The usual path to production is `make promote`,
#                 which ships what staging runs; this one ships a ref.
#
#  NOT zero-downtime for production: `compose up -d` recreates changed
#  containers, and a single replica is unavailable for the seconds that takes.
#
#  Usage: deploy.sh HOST DOMAIN STAGE [REF]
