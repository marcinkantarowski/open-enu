#  make platform-update [FROM=<path or git url>] [REF=<ref>] [BASE=<commit>]
# =============================================================================
#  Brings a project up to a newer version of the platform it was made from.
#
#  A project is a renamed copy: `make init` rewrote the slug, the name and the
#  domain through the whole tree. So the platform's own diff does not apply to
#  it - half its context lines carry the platform's name where the project has
#  its own - and copying files across by hand means redoing that rename by hand,
#  differently each time.
#
#  FROM is the platform: a local checkout, or a git URL (cloned into a cache and
#  fetched on every run). REF is the commit wanted there, HEAD by default. Both
#  FROM and the commit reached are remembered in .project.json, so a later run
#  is just `make platform-update`.
#
#  This does it the way a merge does:
#
#    1. export the platform at the commit the project last had (BASE) and at
#       the one it wants (REF)
#    2. run each export through its OWN `init`, with this project's name - so
#       both are spelled the way the project is
#    3. take the difference between those two and apply it to the project as a
#       three-way merge
#
#  What the project never touched changes silently. What both sides changed is
#  a conflict, marked in the file like any other, for a person to resolve. The
#  result is left STAGED and UNCOMMITTED: the update is one reviewable diff
#  (`git diff --cached`), and committing it is the user's act, not this
#  script's.
#
#  BASE is remembered in .project.json (`platform_ref`) after every run, so it
#  is only ever asked for once, on a project made before this script existed.
