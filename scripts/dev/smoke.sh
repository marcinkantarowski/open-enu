#  Smoke test - does every host actually answer, over trusted TLS?
# =============================================================================
#  Uses --resolve rather than /etc/hosts so this proves Traefik's routing and
#  the certificate, independently of whether the hosts file has been written.
#  It does NOT pass -k: an untrusted certificate is a failure here, because a
#  browser would refuse it too.
#
#  Every target also asserts a SUBSTRING of the body, not only the status code.
#  This is not belt-and-braces: a PHP fatal error renders as HTML with status
#  200, so a status-only check reported this stack fully healthy while the API
#  was failing to boot at all. A check that cannot fail is not a check.
#
#  For the three Nuxt apps the substring is the `app-role` meta tag each one
#  declares in `app.head`. Three reasons it is that and not a phrase from the
#  page:
#    • it is in the HTML shell, so it works for the two apps that render on the
#      client rather than on the server;
#    • it identifies WHICH app answered, so three hosts pointing at one
#      container fails here instead of looking perfectly healthy;
#    • it is a role - "tenant", never the project name - because `make init`
#      rewrites the project name, and a check compared against something the
#      tool rewrites inverts itself
#      (.ai/platform/lessons/sentinel-strings-must-not-be-renameable.md).
