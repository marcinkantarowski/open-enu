#  Type-check all three Nuxt apps.
# =============================================================================
#  The point is not style. API types are GENERATED from openapi.json (ADR-0012),
#  so a backend DTO that loses a field becomes a type error in the component that
#  reads it - at build time, in CI, rather than as `undefined` in a browser.
#
#  Run in the node container so the Node version and the installed modules are
#  the ones the apps actually run with.
#
#  Expect this line, several times, and ignore it:
#
#    [Vue] Resolve plugin path failed: vue-router/volar/sfc-route-blocks
#
#  Nuxt's generated tsconfig registers a vue-tsc plugin that vue-router 4 does
#  not export. It is upstream, it is harmless, and the check still reports real
#  type errors - left visible rather than filtered, because silencing somebody
#  else's warning is how the next real one gets missed.
