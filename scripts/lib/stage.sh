#  Staging and production may share one server or have one each. Either way
#  they must never share anything else: not a directory, not a compose project,
#  not a database volume, not a systemd unit. Every name below carries the
#  stage for that reason - on one box, a name without it is a name two stacks
#  fight over, and the loser is whichever was provisioned first.

#      stage        stack               checkout                 compose files
#      staging      <slug>-staging      /opt/<slug>-staging      dev + staging override
#      production   <slug>-prod         /opt/<slug>-prod         prod
#
#  Also here: `on HOST cmd`, which runs a command on a host over ssh - or right
#  here when HOST is `local`, which is what lets `make promote` work from the
#  staging server itself when production is on the same box.
