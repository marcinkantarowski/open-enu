 * A named hole in a page that other modules may fill.

 *
 * This is the frontend half of the extension-surface rule (.ai/platform/PLAN.md §6.10): a
 * module adds a widget to someone else's page by registering for a named spot,
 * never by editing that page. Two modules can then extend the same screen
 * without touching the same file, which is what keeps a merge from being a
 * negotiation.
 *
 * Unknown names render nothing. That is deliberate - a spot with no
 * contributors is the normal case, not a misconfiguration.
